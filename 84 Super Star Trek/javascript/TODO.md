# to do / maybe do

* starbase computer course function seems not to work

* positive state of repair in damaged systems - a feature? a bug?

* save / load / dump game state, if only for debugging help to repro issue

* switch to a more sensible game loop that can accept flags for next turn or game end

* convert to zero-based array indexes

* ANSI colors!

* offer a few game themes - maybe ST:TNG, BSG, B5?

* cheat codes? for debugging?
