# to do / maybe do

* refactor to use function parameters instead of global vars

* rename variables to more sensible things

* convert to zero-based array indexes

* extract game tuning constants out into a central data structure
  * e.g. likelihood of klingons & starbases spawning, damage /
    repair chances, etc

* maybe abstract away the input / output so that it can run in node and
  a browser?
