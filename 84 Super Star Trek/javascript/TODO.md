# to do / maybe do

* bug in starbase docking - doesn't seem to always work even though I'm right there?

* save / load / dump game state, if only for debugging help to repro issue

* switch to a more sensible game loop that can accept flags for next turn or game end

* convert to zero-based array indexes

* ANSI colors!

* offer a few game themes - maybe ST:TNG, BSG, B5?
